            <h2>What is a Web Browser?</h2>

            <p>A good place to begin talking about web development is with web browsers. If you have ever visited a website, you have also used a web browser! A web browser is <b>an application</b> on your computer, tablet, or smartphone that is <b>responsible for displaying web pages</b> to you. </p>

            <p>There are many web browsers out there, and some are only available on certain devices. If you use an iPhone, iPad or a Mac, you will likely be familiar with Safari. On Windows computers there is a good chance you have used Edge or maybe Internet Explorer. Firefox and Chrome are two other popular browsers that are commonly installed on Android devices.</p>

            <p>When you type something into the search bar in your browser, you are making a request for a web page. The browser will find the source code of the page you are looking for, and convert it to a format that you can view.</p>

            <p>Each web browser has its own quirks, so it is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the page returned looks good and works well, no matter which web browser is used to view the page.</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, all web browsers do the same thing, but each come with their own pros and cons. Some load a little faster, some look a little nicer, some have a few more features. It comes down availability and personal preference; If you have a browser that lets you view the websites you want, that's all you need!</p>
